Airbus Ship Detection Challenge

Problem Statement:
Ever-increasing shipping traffic over time has lead to increased chances of problems at sea, such as shipping accidents and criminality.  Many parties such as envorionmental interest groups, insurance companies, and governments have an interest in being able to quickly find and track ships using satellite imagery.

This is an interesting technological challenge because the source images could include one, many, or no ships in them.  The ships in the images could also potentially be obscured by clouds.

Data:
The data for this project consists of thousands of photos and a CSV file 

This problem comes from a Kaggle challenge and the data will likewise be taken from this challenge.
