<h2>Detecting Ships In Aerial Images</h2>

This repository is my capstone project for the Springboard Machine Learning Engineering track.  For this project, I have taken the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection">Airbus Ship Detection Challenge</a> on Kaggle as the basis of my project.  This provided me with several advantages - a real-world problem to solve with machine learning, interesting and unique challenges to overcome, and a large labeled dataset to work with.  My own project slightly differs from the Airbus challenge in that it performs object detection where the challenge was to perform image segmentation.
